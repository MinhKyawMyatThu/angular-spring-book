# Introduction

There is a book project named [Hands-On-Full-Stack-Development-with-Spring-Boot-2.0-and-Angular-8](https://github.com/hantsy/Hands-On-Full-Stack-Development-with-Spring-Boot-2.0-and-Angular-8) which was initialized by Packt publication, but unfortunately for some personal reason, I can not commit the content in time, so this book project is discontinued now.

I was authorized to deal with the existing work myself. So I created this repository to share some of my original thought of this book, but it is still with no guarantee, I can not promise the progress of the writing.
