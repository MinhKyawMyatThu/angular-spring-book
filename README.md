# Introduction

In the past years, I have developed lots of projects using Spring, esp. Spring Boot, and also contributed much work in the frontend development. I have dreamed again and again to  write something to record my development notes. 

When I began to write such a book, I found it was really not easy as I imagined.  The Packt publication had initialized a book project named [Hands-On-Full-Stack-Development-with-Spring-Boot-2.0-and-Angular-8](https://github.com/hantsy/Hands-On-Full-Stack-Development-with-Spring-Boot-2.0-and-Angular-8) at the beginning of this year, but unfortunately for some personal reason, I can not commit the content in time, that means this book project was discontinued. 

I was authorized to deal with the existing work myself. I decided to write a public book  with the same topic.  



## What's in this book

If we discuss the modern application architecture,  there are a lot of terminologies can be put on the table, such as RESTful architecture, Microservice, Cloud Native applications, etc..

It is difficult to cover so many topics in one book. In this book, we will focus on techniques of developing RESTful APIs.  As a hands-on book, we will create a simple blog system as example, the frontend UI is a standalone SPA(single page application) which is based on Angular, and the backend is based on Spring Boot. The frontend interacts with the backend via RESTful APIs.  

I have published a [Gitbook](https://hantsy.gitbooks.io/build-a-restful-app-with-spring-mvc-and-angularjs/content/) before to describe how to create RESTful APIs with Spring Boot(and without Spring Boot) .  There are lot of changes happened in these technologies in these years.  In this book, we will move to the latest Spring Boot 2.2, you will see the new Spring features is included.  Additionally, the frontend is as part of this book, and it is updated the new Angular 2+ instead of AngularJS(aka Angular 1.x). 

## Audience 

I assume you have some experience of Java EE specification and Spring framework, and have some basic knowledge of frontend development skills, including:

* Java EE 7/Java EE 8 specifications, such as JPA 2.1, Bean Validation 2.0, Dependency Inject, etc..
* The latest Spring framework, such the concept of IOC, Spring MVC,  etc..
* Modern frontend application developments, such as Nodejs/NPM, Webpack, RXJS,  Typescript, etc..
* Basic bash shell scripts, Docker, Docker compose etc. 

But the door to the newbie of these are not closed, if the required skills are not  included in this book , I will add some awesome links of these resources for your to learn them by yourself.

## Resources

* I've created a [Github repository](https://github.com/hantsy/angular-spring-book) to share some of my original thought of this book. You can found all resource of this book in this repository. And the code snippets used in this book is under the **codes** folder.

* I've also created a [GitBook workspace](https://hantsy.gitbook.io/angularspringbook) to synchronize this book source to Gitbook, you can read it online. 

## Contribution

I hope it is a living book, as a reader any contribution is welcome, not limited to file an issue to share your idea, create a pull request in GitHub to fix the errors, even my English grammar etc. 

I have to declare it is still with no guarantee, I can not promise the progress of the writing.
