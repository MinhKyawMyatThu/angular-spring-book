# Fullstack development with Angular and Spring Boot

In the past years, I have developed a lots of projects using Spring, esp. Spring Boot, and aslo contributed much work in the frontend development, I have dreamed again and again to  write something to record my development notes. 

When I began to write such a book, I found it is not easy as I imagined.  There was a book project named [Hands-On-Full-Stack-Development-with-Spring-Boot-2.0-and-Angular-8](https://github.com/hantsy/Hands-On-Full-Stack-Development-with-Spring-Boot-2.0-and-Angular-8) which was initialized by Packt publication, but unfortunately for some personal reason, I can not commit the content in time, that means this book project is discontinued. 

I was authorized to deal with the existing work myself. I decided to write a public book  with the same topic. So I created this repository to share some of my original thought of this book. 

## Audience 

I assume you have some expereince of Spring framework, and have some basic knowledge of frontend development skills. 

## Resources

Go to  Github repository of this book:[https://github.com/hantsy/angular-spring-book](https://github.com/hantsy/angular-spring-book)

I also create a Gitbook workspace to synchronize this book source to Gitbook, [https://hantsy.gitbook.io/angularspringbook](https://hantsy.gitbook.io/angularspringbook), you can read it online. 

## Feedback

I hope it is a living book, anytime you can contribute this book,  not limied to file an issue to share your idea, create a pull request in Github to fix my English grammer etc. 

I have to declare it is still with no guarantee, I can not promise the progress of the writing.
